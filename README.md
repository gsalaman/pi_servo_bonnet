# pi_servo_bonnet
Experiments with the Pi bonnet.

Import library with:
```
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-servokit
```

Uses I2C, so make sure it's enabled via raspi-config.

Scripts do *not* have to be run as sudo.

Also, make sure bonnet is powered with external 5v via the barrel jack.

Seems much smoother than using the Pi's PWM!!!
